# Embedded-LiDAR-Scanner
🛰️ Built an indoor 3D LiDAR-style scanner using an ARM Cortex-M4F microcontroller, time-of-flight sensor, and stepper motor. Programmed precise motor-sensor coordination in C and visualized real-time scans in Python using Open3D. Achieved 1 mm resolution and boosted scan accuracy by 20%.
